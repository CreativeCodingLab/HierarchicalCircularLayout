Hierarchical Circular Layouts
=============
Hierarchical Circular Layouts is a novel visualization technique for representing the structure and connectivity in deeply nested trees. 

This technique supports a range of interactions on this representation, such as collapsing or expanding of node in the hierarchy to simplify or to fully explore its structure, selecting a connection between two nodes, and highlighting relationships involving an selected item in the hierarchy.

Hierarchical Circular Layouts is implemented in D3 (Please use Google Chrome for the best results: http://www2.cs.uic.edu/~tdang/HCL/) as well as in Processing (available at: https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/PathwayViewer).
