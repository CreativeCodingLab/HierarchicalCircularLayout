Hierarchical Circular Layouts
=============
Hierarchical Circular Layouts is a novel visualization technique for representing the structure and connectivity in deeply nested trees. 

This technique supports a range of interactions on this representation, such as collapsing or expanding of node in the hierarchy to simplify or or to fully explore its structure, selecting a connection between two nodes, and highlighting relationships involving an selected item in the hierarchy.

Hierarchical Circular Layouts is implemented in D3 (index.html in this folder) as well as Processing available at: https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/PathwayViewer.
