Hierarchical Circular Layouts
=============
Hierarchical Circular Layouts is a novel visualization technique for representing the structure and connectivity in deeply nested trees. 

This technique supports a range of interactions on this representation, such as collapsing or expanding of node in the hierarchy to simplify or or to fully explore its structure, selecting a connection between two nodes, and highlighting relationships involving an selected item in the hierarchy.

The application (PathwayMatrix_1_1.jar) is available in application.Cross-Platform folder.
